# RobLabEx1
## Objective
"Implementation of a pkg which simulates a set of sensors for encoder readings (position of 6 joints)
and a subscriber that simulates a set of controllers which prints such reading to stdout with ROS_INFO_STREAM"

# Implementation
"The trajectory_msgs::JointTrajectory object has been used to collect the information of the joints.
 Each joint has been implemented with an element of the vector<trajectory_msgs::JointTrajectoryPoint> jtp."
